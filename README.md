# HoughLines

Detects and displays lines found on an image using hough line transform. Implements hough transform from scratch whilst using OpenCV to display results. 

## Usage
The `hough` method outputs the discovered houghlines of an image, whilst the `displayHoughLines` can use the output and the original image to generate these lines.

## Output
Example of hough lines applied to an image:
